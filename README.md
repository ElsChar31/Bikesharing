Tableau Public Outputs
1. Overview of Statistical Analysis - The purpose of this analysis was to create multiple visual representations demonstrating in-depth analysis of raw Citibike data.
 2.	Results
a.	Story 1 – Subscribers user types outnumber customer ones. The ratio is 4:1.
b.	Story 2 – Subscribers partake in far more bike trips than customers. The ratio is 5:1.
c.	Story 3 – Subscribers commit far more start time hours to cycling than customers.
d.	Story 4 – The stations illustrated in this story have the ten largest bike-trip quantities.
e.	Story 5 – More males than females partake in Citibike bike trips. The ratio is 3:1. The unknown total represents individuals that either opted to withhold their gender identity from Citibike or did not complete their paperwork thoroughly.
f.	Story 6
i.	BikeIDs with less than 35 trips will require the lowest number of service visits. 
ii.	Bike IDs with greater than 100 trips will require frequent service visits. 
iii.	The physical bicycles may require replacement resulting in the ID's excision from Citibike records.
g.	Story 7
i.	This bar chart illustrates bike trips as it relates to age. 
ii.	While subscribers embark on more bike trips than customers, patrons 50 years old ride their bicycle more often than their subscriber counterparts.
3.	Summary
a.	Results
i.	Subscribers are more active than customers.
ii.	Subscribers embark on more bike trips; commit more hours to the cycling activity.
iii.	Unfortunately, the raw numbers indicate that subscribers’ bicycles will require more servicing than customers.
iv.	Given the monetary investment subscribers make in their Citibike products, the company’s service department must prepare to spend a substantial amount on parts while managing labor costs.
v.	If subscribers deem their subscription and servicing fees are too high, then these individuals will either explore the competition’s services or give up cycling and divert their energies to more affordable activities.
